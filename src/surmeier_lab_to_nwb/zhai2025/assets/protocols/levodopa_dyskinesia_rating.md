## Abstract

This protocol describes scoring of abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs), the behavioral manifestation of levodopa-induced dyskinesia, in 6-OHDA lesioned mice.

## Materials

- Video camera
- Clean cage bottoms
- L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride (levodopa) (Sigma Aldrich)
- Benserazide hydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich)
- Sterile insulin syringes
- Timer

## Before Start

Generate unilateral 6-OHDA lesioned mice and verify the success of lesioning with the cylinder test.

## Protocol

### Dyskinesia: Abnormal Involuntary Movements (AIMs) score (2h 43m)

1. Dyskinesia is assessed using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement score (AIMs) (Cenci and Lundblad, 2007).

   **CITATION:** Cenci MA, Lundblad M (2007). Ratings of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in the unilateral 6-OHDA lesion model of Parkinson's disease in rats and mice. [https://doi.org/10.1002/0471142301.ns0925s41](https://doi.org/10.1002/0471142301.ns0925s41)

2. Set up behavior room:
   - Place empty, clean cage bottoms (without bedding material) with at least 30 cm in between.
   - Set up video camera.

3. Habituate the mice by bringing their home cage(s) to the behavior room and leaving it undisturbed for at least 30 minutes.

4. Prepare fresh levodopa solution by dissolving 6 mg or 12 mg levodopa (L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride) and 12 mg benserazide hydrochloride in 10 ml sterile saline. This solution is to be used within 40 min.

5. Weigh the first mouse.

6. Perform intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of levodopa (6.0 mg/kg for the first two sessions and 12.0 mg/kg for later sessions) plus 12 mg/kg of benserazide in the first mouse. Place the mouse in a clean cage bottom labeled with its ID. Start the timer. (1 min)

7. After 1 min, inject the second mouse and place it in its labeled cage bottom. Repeat until all mice are injected.

8. 20 minutes after the first injection, videotape and score the first mouse for 1 minute. Repeat for all the mice.

   **Score for each of the three body segments: axial, limb, and orolingual AIMs.** The AIM scale ranges from 0 to 4 for each body segment during a 1-minute period.

   **For each segment:**
   - 0 = normal movement.
   - 1 = abnormal movement for <50% of the time.
   - 2 = abnormal movement for >50% of the time.
   - 3 = abnormal movement for the entire period but can be interrupted by external stimuli (e.g. tapping on the cage wall).
   - 4 = continuous, unsuppressible abnormal movement.

   Half scores (e.g. 1.5, 2.5, 3.5) are possible. (21 min)

9. Repeat Step 8 every 20 minutes for a total period of 2 hours (There must be videos recorded at 20 min, 40 min, 60 min, 80 min, 100 min and 120 min time points for each mouse). (2h 20m)

10. Return the mice to their home cage(s).

11. AIM scoring is performed every other day for a total of five sessions.
