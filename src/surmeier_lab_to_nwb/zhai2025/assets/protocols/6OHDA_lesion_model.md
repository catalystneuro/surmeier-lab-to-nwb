## Abstract
To generate a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, unilateral injection of 6-OHDA(6-hydroxydopamine) into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) was performed. Three to four weeks later, a drug-free cylinder test was used to assess the extent of lesion.

## Guidelines
All procedures were done in aseptic conditions with proper PPEs.

## Materials
- Stereotaxic surgery set-up required (this protocol uses Kopf instruments)
- Isofluorane controller
- Surgical tools
- Ethanol wipes (sterile)
- Iodine wipes (sterile)
- Food color
- 6-Hydroxydopamine hydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in 0.02% ice-cold L-ascorbic acid/saline (3.2 μg free-base 6-OHDA/μL)
- Glass calibrated micropipette (Drummond Scientific Company, 200005)
- Surgical suture (sterile)
- Sterile saline
- Lidocaine cream
- 500 ml glass beaker (e.g. VWR low form Griffin beaker)

## Before Start
Anesthesia of mice was induced at 5% isofluorane and maintained at ~2% isoflurane supplemented with oxygen and mouse body temperature was maintained at 37 degrees Celsius using a temperature controller (ATC1000, World Precision Instruments). Mice were administered with analgesics meloxicam (METACAM®, 0.1mg/kg, s.c., Covetrus) before surgery. Surgeries were performed on a stereotactic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Model 940).

## Procedure

### Stereotaxic Surgery

1. **Anesthetize mouse with isoflurane.**

2. **Shave head and transfer to stereotaxic apparatus** and secure the head and keep mouse anesthetized for length of procedure.

3. **Disinfect surgical area** of the mouse head with 70% ethanol and iodine.

4. **Make a small incision** in the skin to expose the skull.

5. **Carefully remove any connective and muscle tissue** from the exposed area.

6. **Level the skull surface** to be at less than 0.05 mm by comparing the heights of Bregma and Lambda, and also in medial-lateral directions.

### 6-OHDA or Vehicle Injection

7. **Find the drill position** on the skull (the coordinates of the medial forebrain bundle are: AP= -0.7 mm from Bregma, ML= -1.2 mm from Bregma, DV= -4.75 from the dura surface) and mark the position with food color.

8. **Drill Burr-hole** in marked areas carefully.

9. **Attach glass calibrated micropipette** (Drummond Scientific) to the pipette holder.
   - 9.1. Front-fill the pipette with freshly dissolved 6-OHDA. Avoid any bubbles.

10. **Bring the pipette tip to Bregma** and zero the coordinates
    - 10.1. Move the pipette to the position right above the MFB and slowly insert the pipette tip into the brain until it reaches the MFB coordinates.
    - 10.2. Leave the pipette in place for at least 2 minutes before injection.

11. **Inject 1 μl of 6-OHDA** at a speed < 0.5 μl/min. Wait 10 minutes after injection before slowly removing the pipette.

### Post-operative Care

12. **Close the incision** with surgical suture. Apply sterile lidocaine cream on the wound.

13. **Inject 0.5 ml sterile saline i.p.** to prevent dehydration.

14. **Keep the mouse on a clean cage bottom** (on a heating pad) until it recovers from the anesthesia. Transfer the mouse back to its clean home cage.
    - 14.1. The cage should be kept on the heating pad during the first 2 weeks post-surgery to avoid hypothermia.

15. **During the first 2 to 3 weeks of surgery**, mice receive daily subcutaneous injections of sterile saline and dietary supplementations.

### Cylinder Test

16. **Three to four weeks after 6-OHDA lesion**, cylinder test is performed.
    - 16.1. Place the mouse in 500 ml beaker and start the timer.

17. **Count the numbers of weight-bearing touches** by left and right forepaws in 3 min.

18. **Calculate the percentage** of (right paw touches/total touches). If this percentage is less than 25%, the mouse is considered near-complete lesioned and used for experiments.
