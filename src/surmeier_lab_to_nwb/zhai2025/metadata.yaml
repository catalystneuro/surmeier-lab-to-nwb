    Corticostriatal synaptic strength analysis in levodopa-induced dyskinesia using Sr2+-oEPSC measurements.
    This study examines state-dependent modulation of synaptic connectivity in a Parkinson's disease model
    by comparing on-state and off-state recordings. Mice received dyskinesiogenic levodopa treatment and were sacrificed
    either 30 min post-dose (on-state) or 24-48h post-dose (off-state). Data corresponds to Figure 2
    from Zhai et al. 2025.
