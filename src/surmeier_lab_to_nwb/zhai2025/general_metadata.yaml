  experiment_description: |
    Generic description of the experiment.
  surgery: |
    Unilateral stereotaxic lesion: 1 µl of 6-hydroxydopamine
    (≈3 µg in 0.02 % ascorbate-saline) injected into the right
    medial forebrain bundle (AP -0.7 mm, ML -1.2 mm, DV -4.75 mm
    from bregma) under isoflurane anaesthesia; post-operative
    meloxicam, saline, and warming provided. Lesion efficacy later
    confirmed by drug-free forelimb-asymmetry (cylinder) test.
  pharmacology: |
    Induction anaesthesia with isoflurane (5 % v/v for induction,
    2 % for maintenance). Pre-operative analgesia: meloxicam
    0.1 mg kg⁻¹ s.c. Lesion: intracranial 6-hydroxydopamine, 1 µl
    of 3.5 mg ml⁻¹ free-base 6-OHDA in 0.02 % ascorbate-saline
    into the right medial forebrain bundle. L-DOPA priming for LID:
    five i.p. injections every other day—6 mg kg⁻¹ for the first
    two sessions, 12 mg kg⁻¹ thereafter—each co-administered with
    benserazide 12 mg kg⁻¹ to inhibit peripheral decarboxylation.
  slices: |
    Sagittal slices (280-μm thick) were sectioned using a vibratome (Leica VT1200).
    After cutting, slices were incubated at 34 °C for 30 min in ACSF containing
    (in mM): 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 2.0 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3
    and 13.89 glucose, after which they were stored at room temperature until
    recording. External solutions were oxygenated with carbogen (95%CO2/5%O2)
    at all time.
