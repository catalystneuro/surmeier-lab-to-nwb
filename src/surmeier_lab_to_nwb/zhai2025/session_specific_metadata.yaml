Images were deconvolved using AutoQuant X3.0.4 (MediaCybernetics) and semi-automated spine counting was performed using 3D reconstructions in NeuronStudio (CNIC, Mount Sinai). This data is part of Figure 8, which investigates the role of M1R signaling in spine density using CRISPR."

Data corresponds to Figure 8 from Zhai et al. 2025. M1R CRISPR uses CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to delete M1 muscarinic receptors specifically from iSPNs. Uses optimized DynamicTable for figure analysis."
