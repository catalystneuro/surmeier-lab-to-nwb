# Figure 1 Conversion Notes

## Overview
Figure 1 demonstrates state-dependent changes in dSPN (direct pathway spiny projection neurons) excitability between LID on- and off-states. The data includes:
- **Somatic excitability**: Current injection protocols measuring rheobase and F-I relationships
- **Dendritic excitability**: Combined patch clamp + two-photon line scan imaging measuring calcium transients
- **Immunostaining**: Confocal images showing pERK and TH expression

## Experimental Protocols

### Somatic Excitability Protocol

**Methodology**: Whole-cell patch clamp recording in current clamp mode

> Somatic excitability data were generated by recording voltage changes in response to current injection steps that are 500 ms in duration.

**Current Steps**:
- Range: -120 pA to +300 pA
- Step size: 20 pA
- Duration: 500 ms each
- Total steps: 21 (from cell1-001 to cell1-021)

**Analysis**: F-I relationship curves and rheobase measurements

### Dendritic Excitability Protocol

**Methodology**: Combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM)

> To assess dSPN dendritic excitability in on- and off-states, a combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) was used. Specifically, dSPNs in ex vivo brain slices from off- or on-state mice were patch clamped, filled with Ca2+-sensitive dye Fluo-4 and Ca2+-insensitive dye Alexa Fluor 568 (to visualize dendrites), **and injected with brief current steps (three 2 nA injections, 2 ms each, at 50 Hz)**.

**Stimulus Protocol**:
```
Current (nA)
  2 |   ___      ___      ___
    |  |   |    |   |    |   |
  0 |__|   |____|   |____|   |____
      <-2ms->    <-2ms->    <-2ms->
      <---20ms--><---20ms--->
```

**Physiological Rationale**:
- **Back-propagating action potentials (bAPs)**: Somatically delivered current steps evoke spikes that back-propagate into SPN dendrites
- **Calcium signaling**: bAPs trigger transient opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, producing measurable calcium transients
- **Dendritic excitability assessment**: Magnitude of Ca2+ signals serves as a surrogate estimate of dendritic depolarization extent

**Analysis**:
- Ca2+ signals measured at proximal (~40 μm from soma) and distal (~90 μm from soma) dendritic locations
- **Distal/proximal ratio**: Used as index of dendritic excitability, normalized for experimental variables (dye concentration, laser intensity)
- **Significance**: Higher ratio indicates greater dendritic excitability and more effective bAP invasion

**Key Finding**: Dendritic excitability index significantly greater in on-state dSPNs than in off-state dSPNs (p = 0.0115)

## Key Metadata

### Line Scan Geometry (from .env files)
```xml
<LineScanController>
  <StraightLine XStart="0.3047" XStop="0.8000" Y="0.6328"/>
</LineScanController>
```
- Coordinates are normalized (0-1) defining scan line in field of view

### Profile Window Definition
```xml
<LineScanProfiles DataFile="..._LineProfileData.csv">
  <Profile number="1" channel="1" x0="0" x1="16"/>
  <Profile number="2" channel="2" x0="0" x1="16"/>
</LineScanProfiles>
```

### Stimulus Parameters (from VoltageOutput XML)
```json
"WaveformComponent_PulseTrain": {
    "Name": "Theta burst",
    "PulseCount": "3",
    "PulseWidth": "2",
    "PulseSpacing": "18",
    "PulsePotentialStart": "5",
    "PulsePotentialDelta": "0",
    "RestPotential": "0",
    "FirstPulseDelay": "900",
    "Repetitions": "1",
    "DelayBetweenReps": "158"
}
```

**Parameter Interpretation**:
- **PulseCount**: 3 → Three current injections
- **PulseWidth**: 2 ms → Each injection lasts 2 ms
- **PulseSpacing**: 18 ms → 18 ms between pulse starts (16 ms gap + 2 ms pulse = ~55 Hz)
- **PulsePotentialStart**: 5 → With UnitScaleFactor 400 and Units "pA" = 2000 pA = 2 nA
- **FirstPulseDelay**: 900 ms → Stimulus starts 900 ms after recording begins

## Channel Assignments

### Two-Photon Imaging Channels
- **Channel 1 (Ch1)**: Fluo-4 calcium-sensitive dye (green, 490-560 nm)
- **Channel 2 (Ch2)**: Alexa Fluor 568 structural dye (red, 580-620 nm)

### Kymograph Structure
- **Dimensions**: (C, T, X) where C=channels, T=time/lines, X=pixels along scan line
- **Typical size**: 2 channels × 2500 time points × 64 pixels per line

## Acquisition Parameters

### Electrophysiology
> All the electrophysiological recordings were made using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instrument, USA), and signals were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Voltage protocols and data acquisition were performed by PrairieView 5.3 (Bruker).

### Two-Photon Imaging
> The recorded SPN was visualized using 810 nm excitation laser (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent, Santa Clara, USA). Dendritic structure was visualized by the red signal of Alexa Fluor 568 detected by a Hamamatsu R3982 side-on photomultiplier tube (PMT, 580-620 nm). Calcium transients, as signals in the green channel, were detected by a Hamamatsu H7422P-40 GaAsP PMT (490-560 nm, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan).

**Line Scan Parameters**:
- **Pixels per line**: 64
- **Dwell time**: 10 μs/pixel
- **Typical acquisition**: 2500 lines (time points)
- **Temporal resolution**: ~640 μs per line (64 pixels × 10 μs/pixel)
- **Total recording duration**: ~1.6 seconds for 2500 lines

**Imaging Strategy**:
- **Dendritic targeting**: Line scans positioned along dendrites at specific distances from soma
- **Dual-channel acquisition**: Simultaneous recording of calcium (Fluo-4) and structural (Alexa Fluor 568) signals
- **Spatial calibration**: Distances measured from soma to scan locations using structural channel
- **Signal validation**: Structural channel confirms dendrite integrity throughout recording

## Experimental Timeline Analysis

Based on timestamp analysis from the raw data, the experimental sequence follows this pattern:

| Time | Experiment | Location |
|------|------------|----------|
| 14:58:20 | Cell1_prox1_trio-001 | Proximal dendrite, trial 1 |
| 14:58:33 | Cell1_prox1_trio-002 | Proximal dendrite, trial 2 |
| 14:58:46 | Cell1_prox1_trio-003 | Proximal dendrite, trial 3 |
| 15:00:26 | Cell1_dist1_trio-001 | Distal dendrite, trial 1 |
| 15:00:42 | Cell1_dist1_trio-002 | Distal dendrite, trial 2 |
| 15:01:06 | Cell1_dist1_trio-003 | Distal dendrite, trial 3 |

**Pattern**: 3 trials at proximal location, then 3 trials at distal location, with ~13-24 second intervals between trials.
